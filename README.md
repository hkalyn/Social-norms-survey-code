# Social-norms-survey-code

This is the code and cleaned data (with identifiers removed) for our paper entitled, "From Merton to Market: Nomrative Tensions in Canadian Science". 

Appendix 2 ran univariate and multivariate models to predict item response for all responses in our survey. We ran analyses separately for faculty and trainees. You can view sample code in 'Predict_response_variation_sample_code'. This provides the full code for item: Communality 1. One can re-run this script for any item by replacing the item code in the dataset.

Appendix 3 ran multivariate models to predict the 'ideal-actual' gap in responses in our survey. We ran analyses separately for faculty and trainees. You can view sample code in 'Predict_differential_gap_sample_code'. This provides the PPCA component extraction and full model code for items: Communality 1 and 2. One can re-run this script for any item by replacing the item code in the dataset.

We cannot provide our full dataset as an open source document. There are many secondary identifying variables in our dataset, and we will not risk the privacy and anonymity of our participants. A cleaned dataset is provided for the faculty and trainees separately with all identifiers removed except gender and research domain.
